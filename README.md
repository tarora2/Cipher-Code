For this project, you will implement a program named Cipher that uses a scheme similar to the one given above to encode and decode files. To make it possible to decode an encoded file and recover the original file, all characters on each line, including spaces, tabs, punctuation, etc., will be “shuffled.” For example, the line
Hello World!
would be encoded as
HloWrdel ol!
The user will provide an input file. Your application will provide the encoded/decoded file in an output file.
